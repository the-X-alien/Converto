# July 9th: Speed Running the PCB!

I speedran the whole process of making the schematic and PCB. I researched what the pins on the USB C Port do and then I found out most of them are just connected to power and only a few actually transmit data. So I connected the ones that transmit data. Then I created the board shape to look like a rectangle so it kind of fits in your hand like a USB. Finally I routed all the traces and exported the gerber files.

# July 9th: Speed Running the BOM and Github Repo!

I saw something on the Highway slack channel about how LCSC has all the parts you need so I searched LCSC for the parts I thought would fit my project. Then I formatted the BOM and I uploaded all the files. Finally I added a finished picture and now I am writing the JOURNAL.md.
